On your first time using this plugin (or whenever microsoft decides to say you have to), run the command ";lambda-auth" and follow the instructions

IF USING A MICROSOFT ACCOUNT AND SOMETHING FAILS, DO NOT SEND A FULL LOG WHEN ASKING FOR HELP, AS IT MAY CONTAIN SENSITIVE INFORMATION  

If authentication fails, and you see a mention of the term "XErr" in the log, followed by a number, here are what the numbers mean:  

2148916233: You do not have an xbox account connected to your microsoft account, create one by logging into [minecraft](https://minecraft.net)  

2148916235: Your account is from a country where xbox live does not work  

2148916238: Your account is under 18 and it is not linked to a family, only the official launcher can log such accounts in and there is nothing i can do
